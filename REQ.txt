【Take-home assignment】

1. Develop a simple website:
    Frontend: Use React.js to build a simple web page (whatever you like to present). Just like to see if you know how to use components with React.
    Backend: Use Django to build at least two API endpoints for the frontend page you created to use.

2. Deploy the website to AWS:
    Basic requirements
        Use AWS S3 to deploy your frontend code.
        Use AWS EC2 to deploy your backend code.
        Ensure the website is accessible publicly.
    Bonus requirements:
        Use AWS CloudFront for CDN.
        Create a custom VPC with one private subnet and put your EC2 in it.

3. Provide a presentation of your work (PDF, PPT, online demo, etc.):
    Include an overview of your tech stack and architecture.
    Explain the deployment process to AWS.
    Provide a live demo or screenshots of the running website and its key features.
